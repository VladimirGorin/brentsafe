          <p> First, you need your own Digital Wallet (either an online wallet, or an exchange) that you will use to fund your paper wallet. If you still do not have an account in an exchange or online wallet, we recommend one of these: Binance, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Ripio. Once you have funds in your Digital Wallet, you can deposit the amount you want to transfer in your paper wallet, simply by using public wallet address from your printed cold paper wallet, or you can deposit your cold paper wallet with debit/credit card or with BITCOIN ATM receipt.
